### Changed

PLT-5462 adds a cabal flag `--flag trace-plutus` for the `marlowe-cardano` and `marlowe-test` packages. In production this flag should not be set because it enlarges the validator and changes its hash. If the flag is turned on, however, the test suite `test:marlowe-test` will check the Plutus logs to see that the correct error is occurring in cases where the validator should fail.

This flag is also useful in `marlowe-cli` for creating a tracing validator for on-chain usage.
